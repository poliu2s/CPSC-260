Project Name: Word Search Helper Program


Project Description:

This program solves word search puzzles given to it through a .txt file.
The sample .txt file contains a 10x10 matrix of characters that 
simulate a word search puzzle which is then specified within program.
The user of the program only has to specify which words to search for
and enters it into the GUI which. It then highlights the first character
in red and the rest of the characters in blue. The program is capable of
looking left, right, up, down, diagonally up-right, diagonally up-left,
diagonally down-left, diagonally down-right relative to the first character.

The program is limited in that currently it must accept a 10x10 matrix 
from an external .txt file although simple motifications can be made so
that it accepts files with different dimensions. Another limitation is that
the program only finds the first word that it searches for in the
text matrix so if the word of interest is repeated, the repeats will
not be found.



For marking purposes:

-The 4 user defined classes are: searchWindow, data, inputFormatter, and MyLinkedList
-Inheritance is used in searchWindow.h as it inherits functions from window.h
-A virtual method is implemented in the destructor of searchWindow
-A Dynamic data structure in the form of a linked list is used in MyLinkedList
-searchWindow is also a GUI that has user interaction (text box)
